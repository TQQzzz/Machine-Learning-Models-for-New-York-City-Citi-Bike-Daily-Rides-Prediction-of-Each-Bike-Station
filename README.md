# Machine-Learning-Models-for-New-York-City-Citi-Bike-Daily-Rides-Prediction-of-Each-Bike-Station
Abstract
This study aims to develop an accurate model for predicting the daily ridership of Citi Bike stations in New York City, which can help optimize operations such as bike redistribution, maintenance, and pricing strategies. We compare the performance of various machine learning models, including decision trees, support vector machines, naive Bayes, and random forests, using a dataset that includes demographic and temporal features. Our results indicate that the random forest model has the highest predictive accuracy, with some limitations identified in certain census tracts. Future research could explore incorporating additional features, such as weather data or urban infrastructure, to improve prediction accuracy.
